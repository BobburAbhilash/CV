I am an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

In my research, I try understand how learners work with data as a context for learning, particularly in science content areas. I am particularly interested in how learners come to use data to answer scientific questions that are personally meaningful to them. I use a variety of methods to carry out this research, including design-based research and quantitative research methods, such as the experience sampling method and multi-level (or hierarchical linear) models. 

I have taught classes in science education, teacher education, educational psychology, educational technology, and research methods. 

I earned my doctorate at Michigan State University in 2018. Prior to my PhD, I completed a master's degree in education, also from Michigan State University, while I was teaching at a public high school.

I'm committed to open science and research; accordingly, I share links to pre-prints of my publications, resources related to presentations, and software, data, and code on this and on my on [this](/Research) page. Also, [all of the content on this website and its source code](https://github.com/jrosen48/homepage-source) can be viewed and re-purposed.
