My research focuses on supporting and documenting learners' engagement in activities focused around work with data. I also explore how new data sources and methods (such as log-trace data and network analysis) can be used as part of educational research.

The aims of this work are to design curricula and tools centered around learners' use of data to make sense of phenomena and to document student engagement and learning. I carry out my research and development in the context of classrooms (at the K-12 and post-secondary levels) and other settings.

This page contains information on publications (peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings), other products (R packages and simulations for learners) as well as information about ongoing research projects.
