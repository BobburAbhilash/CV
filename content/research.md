# Research Interests

My research focuses on supporting and documenting learners' engagement in activities focused around work with data. I also explore how new data sources and methods (such as log-trace data and network analysis) can be used as part of educational research.

The aims of this work are to design curricula and tools centered around learners' use of data to make sense of phenomena and to document student engagement and learning. I carry out my research and development in the context of classrooms (at the K-12 and post-secondary levels) and other settings.

## Ongoing Research Projects

Here is information about ongoing and recently completed research projects.

**Profiles of Science Engagement**

With [Jennifer Schmidt (MSU)](http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu), [Neil Naftzger (American Institutes for Research)](http://www.air.org/person/neil-naftzger), [Lee Shumow (Northern Illinois University)](http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu) and colleagues.

* Investigate student engagement through the use of data collected through an Experience Sampling Method (ESM).
* Use data collected from both middle and high school classes as well as outside-of-school STEM programs.
* Using person-oriented and within-person analytic approaches.

**STEM Interest and Engagement**

With [Jennifer Schmidt (MSU)](http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu), [Lee Shumow (Northern Illinois University)](http://education.msu.edu/search/FormView.aspx?email=jaschmid%40msu.edu), and colleagues.

* Explore the impact of learners' participation in outside-of-school STEM programs.
* Understand momentary, personal, and program predictors of students' interest and engagement.
* Use of ESM, survey, and video data and use mixed effects (or multi-level) models.

**The REX Virtual Experiment Platform**

With [Rochelle Schwartz-Bloom (Duke)](https://dibs.duke.edu/scholars/rochelle-schwartz-bloom), [Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia (MSU)](http://llgarcia.educ.msu.edu/), and colleagues.

* Understand high school students' development of situational interest as part of their use of an online virtual experiment platform. 
* Use self-report and log-trace data to document student motivation and learning.

**Teaching and Learning in Online Science Classes at Michigan Virtual School**

With [John Ranellucci (Hunter College)](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/school-of-education/departments/education-foundations/faculty/john-ranellucci).

* Design activities to support student work with authentic data sources in high school science classes.
* Document the development of students' ability to engage in work with data through the use of embedded assessments.
* Use self-report and log-trace data to explore relationships among students' motivation, engagement, and achievement.

**Supporting Scientific Practices in Elementary and Middle School Classrooms**

With [Christina Schwarz (MSU)](http://education.msu.edu/search/formview.aspx?email=cschwarz%40msu.edu), [Christina Krist (University of Illinois)](http://www.christinakrist.org/), [Brian Reiser (Northwestern University)](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/profile/?p=80), and colleagues.

* Develop curricula, providing teacher professional development, and documenting student (and teacher) learning across multiple years.
* Document student learning using computational and traditional qualitative and quantitative approaches.
* Understand longitudinal changes in teachers' instructional practice focused around support students' development of scientific models of phenomena.

**The MSU-Wipro STEM & Leadership Teaching Fellowship**

With [Leigh Graves Wolf (MSU)](https://www.leighgraveswolf.com/), [Punya Mishra (Arizona State)](http://www.punyamishra.com/), [Matthew Koehler (MSU)](http://www.matt-koehler.com/) and colleagues.

* Develop and explore the development of online learning communities through the use of a Twitter hashtag, a Facebook group, and other educational and communication technologies.
* Use social network analysis models and methods to understand how teachers' influence one another and impact changes in their teaching practice.
