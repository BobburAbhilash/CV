<h2 id="about-and-contact">About and Contact</h2>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</p>

<p>In my research, I try understand how learners work with data as a context for learning, particularly in science content areas. I am particularly interested in how learners come to use data to answer scientific questions that are personally meaningful to them. I use a variety of methods to carry out this research, including design-based research and quantitative research methods, such as the experience sampling method and multi-level (or hierarchical linear) models.</p>

<p>I have taught classes in science education, teacher education, educational psychology, educational technology, and research methods.</p>

<p>I earned my doctorate at Michigan State University in 2018. Prior to my PhD, I completed a master&rsquo;s degree in education, also from Michigan State University, while I was teaching at a public high school.</p>

<p>I maintain profiles / accounts on the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Rosenberg2">ResearchGate</a></li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nxVowRQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My email is jmrosenberg [at] UTK [dot] edu.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m committed to open science and research; accordingly, I share links to pre-prints of my publications, resources related to presentations, and software, data, and code on this and on my on <a href="/Research">this</a> page. Also, <a href="https://github.com/jrosen48/homepage-source">all of the content on this website and its source code</a> can be viewed and re-purposed.</p>
