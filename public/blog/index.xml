      <description>My goal: To write a CV in one format and in a way so that it can be rendered in multiple formats I have trying to write my CV once and have it be displayed/rendered as HTML (for this website), a PDF (for sharing), and a Word document (also for sharing - as some folks require it to be in this format).
I have something that seems to work and so thought I would share what I did as a first attempt.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to present on Data Science Education Dilemmas (and Opportunities) to STEM Education faculty at UT. It was a short, informal presentation, but served as a chance to pull together some ideas.
A link to the presentation is here.</description>
