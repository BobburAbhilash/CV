<p>Here is a bit more information on the webinar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only in science and science education but also our everyday lives, data are powerful, but opportunities for students to think of and with data as part of their learning are limited. This webinar discusses activities focused on work with data (or data practices) in the context of the Next Generation Science Standards and Michigan Science Standards as well as recommendation for engaging students in data practices based on findings from a design-based research study carried out at MVS.</p>
