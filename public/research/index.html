<h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>

<p>My research focuses on supporting and documenting learners&rsquo; engagement in activities focused around work with data. I also explore how new data sources and methods (such as log-trace data and network analysis) can be used as part of educational research.</p>

<p>The aims of this work are to design curricula and tools centered around learners&rsquo; use of data to make sense of phenomena and to document student engagement and learning. I carry out my research and development in the context of classrooms (at the K-12 and post-secondary levels) and other settings.</p>
