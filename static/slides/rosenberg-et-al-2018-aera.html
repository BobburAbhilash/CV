# Patterns of engagement in a flipped undergraduate class: Antecedents and outcomes
### JMR

#  Background 

+ Lectures are a common feature of instruction (Mazur, 2009; Smith &amp; Valentine, 2012)
+ The *flipped class* has become an increasingly common design
	+ Outside-of-class, students view video-recordings of lectures
	+ In-class, students  participate in other activities

---
#  Need for study 

+ Past research on impacts of flipping is quite limited
+ Participation in outside of class activities is key (Chen &amp; Wu, 2015; He, Holton, Farkas, &amp; Warschauer, 2016)

---
#  Intensive data and engagement 

+ Digital sources of data can be used to study learning and engagement (D’Mello, Dieterle, &amp; Duckworth, 2017; Gobert, Baker, &amp; Wixon, 2015)
+ Trace measures, like students’ online lecture viewing, can be especially useful for measuring behavioral engagement (Azevedo, 2015)

#  Theoretical framework: Expectancy-value theory 

+ (Eccles, 1983; Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)

#  Purpose of the present study 

+ Explore **students’ out-of-class engagement in the flipped classroom** using longitudinal growth models
	+ Investigate antecedents
	+ Investigate outcomes

---
#  Research questions 

+ What patterns of engagement outside-of-class do students in the flipped class exhibit?
+ What student characteristics predict their patterns of engagement?
+ How does students’ engagement predict achievement-related outcomes?

---
#  Participants and instructional context 

+ 272 undergraduates in a large introductory anatomy course
+ Students were assigned to view 58 videos over the semester
+ In-class activities largely consisted of small-group work

#  Data analysis 


**Model for RQ #1** : Mixed effects (or multi-level) model predicting time viewed

Y time-viewed-i = b 00 + intercept-term i * b b 10 + linear-slope i * b 20 + quadratic-term i * b 30 + e j

b 00 = b 00 + person-specific-intercept-effect j *µ 1

b 10 = b 10 + person-specific-linear-slope-effect j *µ 2

b 20 = b 20 + person-specific-quadratic-term-effect j *µ 3

**Models RQ #2** : Predicting student-specific effects

**Models for RQ #3** : Predicting outcomes using student-specific effects

#  Predicting time viewed 

+ Viewing started at a moderately high level and exhibited linear and quadratic patterns of change
+ Statistically significant variability in patterns of viewing
+ New insight into outside of class engagement via online lecture viewing in the flipped classroom

---
#  Antecedents of student-specific patterns 

+ No statistically significant relations between antecedents (perceptions of competence and effort cost) and student-specific
+ Some relations between effort cost with students’ rate of viewing and change in rate of viewing were positive
	+ But did not meet the criterion for statistical significance
+ Suggestive of further work on the role of cost given past research (e.g., Perez, Cromley, &amp; Kaplan, 2014)

---
#  Predicting students’ outcomes 

+ Consistent, positive relations between initial time viewed(i.e., students’ intercept terms) and achievement
+ Positive change in the rate of viewing (i.e., students’ quadratic terms) was negatively related to the proximal outcome, Exam 2
	+ Increasing the rate at which one views is associated with lower achievement
	+ May indicate “cramming” before an exam

---
#  Limitations of the study 

+ Use of person-specific terms in *other* models (Houslay &amp; Wilson, 2017)

Y time-viewed-i = b 00 + linear-term i * b b 1 + linear-slope i * b 2 + quadratic-term i * b 3 + e j

b 00 = b 00 + person-specific-intercept-effect j *µ 1

b 10 = b 10 + person-specific-linear-slope-effect j *µ 2

b 20 = b 20 + person-specific-quadratic-term-effect j *µ 3
+ Role of other dimensions of engagement (Fredericks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004; Sinatra et al., 2015)
+ Consideration of students’ outside effort, loss of valued alternatives, and emotional cost (Flake, Barron, Hulleman, McCoach, &amp; Welsh, 2015 ) in the flipped class

---
#  Future research 

+ Explore other antecedents of engagement, especially other expectancy beliefs
+ Better understand utility of log-trace measures of engagement (e.g., Henrie, Bodily, Larsen, &amp; Graham, 2015; Henrie, Bodily, Manwaring, &amp; Graham, advance online publication)
+ Consider a one-step analytic approach

---
#  Implications for practice 

+ Instructors may  suggest to students benefits of a more consistent pattern of viewing videos
	+ Support students’ autonomy and self-regulatory capabilities (i.e., M-Flip)
+ Consider students’ motivation and individual differences in reasons for enrolling in the flipped class
